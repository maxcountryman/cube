# Magic: the Gathering Cube

This is a visual spoiler for my cube. The cube is based off of the Fall 2014
MTGO Legacy cube but has since evolved in important ways--noteably, it is no
longer Legacy-legal.

## Overview

The cube consists of 600 cards: 115 colorless, 60 two-color pairs, 85 mono
black, 84 mono blue, 85 mono green, 84 mono red, 85 mono white, 1 Grixis, 1
rainbow.

Various archetypes are supported, from control, to combo, to reanimator, to
mono-red aggro. The overall power-level of cards is meant to be high, however
the cube is unpowered--there are no Black Lotus or Moxen and no Sol Ring.

Drafters are generally rewarded when they find an archetype and stick to it.
Be that a blue control deck or a green ramp deck, finding a lane usually yields
better results than simply drafting "good stuff" midrange.

While the cube does not contain power, it does contain very powerful cards,
some of which can win the game on their own. Finding one of these cards and
building around it is often a winning strategy and an intentional design facet.

## Evolution

By putting the cube on Github (thank's to @davidchambers for inviting me to
fork his cube) the hope is to encourage a collective process whereby the cube
is designed and evolved by you! Personally I hope to continue to push the cube
in the direction of fun, interactive games. For me cube as a format is best
when both the opponent and I get to do some of the more broken things in Magic.
So your input is very much appreciated and you should feel free to open issues
with suggestions for changes to the cube.
